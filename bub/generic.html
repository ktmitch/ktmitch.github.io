						My baby is truly one of a kind. Intelligent, funny as hell, and as 
						caring as a mom to her newborn child. These are only 3 reasons why 
						I wanted to keep her in my daily life since we started talking.
					</p>

					<p>There's not many girls that would do what she has done for me and 
						hold me down with her spunk. I need to remind myself of what she 
						has done, even though our situations are different in some aspects. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						One thing about her is that she's a go-getter. From when we started
						talking to now, she's graduated college with a great GPA, she's 
						gotten called for interviews for various tough positions, 
						interned and eventually started working two jobs, 
						and obtained her driving license. 
						She started drawing again, as I look at my professional-like drawing of Pain (watch Naruto!), 
						and started her Youtube channel after hesitating for years. I think I will use
						this time to tell her that she motivates me daily to do my things and things I've
						thought of and I'm very thankful for each joule of energy she has put into that.

					</p>

					<!-- <p style="text-align: center;">I'm sorry for the times that I have had a negative effect on you, 
						with the most recent as the main focus of that sentence above. I don't blame you
						if you can't find it in your heart to turn around 100% after we went through what we did.
						Do not break down your walls completely, don't rush, and continue to analyze everything,
						especially your heart. 
						It's not easy, and no direct answer as to how to get through individually and together.
						Let's continue to do our best and I'll support any decision at the end of the day you
						decide to make as long as you'll be okay &#128154;! God bless always! He will guide us down
						our best paths, trust in him and we shall continue to try, work, and trust in us! -->
