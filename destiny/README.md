Welcome to the game of Destiny! This is a mini game created by Kevin Mitchell (Me)

Homepage:
The front page has the objective of the game and how to play. 
User clicks the Destiny Icon to start the game.

Selection Page:
The user then enters their Guardian information and picks a Guardian class, each having
a unique ability used by clicking the "Super".

Game:
User selects Start Battle to start the battle. They select Attack to deal damage 
to the enemy based on the user's current level and can press Super once per battle
to unleash their special attack. After defeating an enemy, user selects Next
Battle to fight the next enemy. Defeat Oryx to beat the game!

Video is attached, also. (Feel free to fast forward video showcasing the game)

Inspiration:
After doing a practice Rock, Paper, and Scissors game, I decided to a more fun and advanced version using somewhat similar logic
