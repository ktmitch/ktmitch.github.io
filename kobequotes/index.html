        <h4 id="ab"><em>About</em><hr>For one of my senior projects in college, I created a 5-page website dedicated to Kobe Bryant as he was a big inspiration to my life. After I graduated, the files were deleted off the server and the hard drive with the files became corrupted. Kobe's passing inspired me to create another from scratch showcasing Kobe's Mamba Mentality, his motivation, and his greatness along with some of my web development skills.<hr>This generates a random quote from Kobe and a random background about him. I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<i class="fas fa-times-circle" id="close" onclick="info()" title="Close"></i></h4>

    </div>

    <div class="container">
    <h2 id="quote">Thank you Kobe!</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container actions">
    <button type="button" id="getquote" onclick="getquote()" title="Generate random quote and background!"><strong>Click Here</strong></button> <!--Rolls a random quote and background-->

    <!-- This is one of the hardest projects I've ever done. Not only because of the code, but because it involves a person that passed who was a big part of my life throughout both my childhood and adulthood along with the fact that it involved others including his daughter. No matter the amount of tears that roll down my eyes, I vowed to finish the base of this project by 8/24, officially announced Kobe Day in Orange County.-->

    <!-- Update on 8/23 - On Kobe Bryant's birthday, the base project has been completed -->
